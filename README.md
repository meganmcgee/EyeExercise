## Description

This project was an assignment through the MIT xPro Certificate in Coding program, in which I am currently enrolled. We were given some starter code and asked to fill in the missing pieces. For example, we had to add the second eye in the html file as well as complete the JS function to make it run correctly.

## How To Use

If you follow the link [Eye Movement](http://meganmcgee.github.io/EyeExercise/) you will see a set of eye in the middle of the page. As you move your mouse the eyes will follow along the track of your mouse.

## Future Improvements

If I were going to make improvements to this project, I might try to add a function that makes the eyes blink when you click your mouse. This would require creating the "eyelids" that are called from a JS function using "onclick".
